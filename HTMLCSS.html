<h2><strong>HTML</strong></h2>
<p id="html">Hyper<br>
Text<br>
Markup<br>
Language</p>
<p class="html-para">HTML was created back in 1990. It's intended use was to allow 
people to exchange scientific and other types of documents. HTML was
easy to learn and went mainstream quickly. Browsers began to be created
and competed with other browsers by making them more stylish. HTML was
a great system that flourished, especially over time, with more better written
HTML and the development of CSS.</p>

<h2><strong>CSS</strong></h2>
<p id="css"> Cascading<br>
Style<br>
Sheets<br></p>
<p class="css-para"> CSS originates back to 1996 and was created so 
that there was an easier way of displaying special content. That team,
<span>W3C</span>, released CSS level one and is now implemented in many browsers. 
There are <strong>tons</strong> of benefits to using CSS, like it's 
consistency or how simple it is to change the atmosphere of a site
by just changing the style sheet. Websites have drastically changed
ever since CSS was added and is a staple in creating one.</p>
