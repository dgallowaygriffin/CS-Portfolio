<div id="liter-book"><h2 class="liter">Literature</h2>
 
 <p class="p-2">Surprisingly enough, an interest of mine is a school subject, which is literature.
 Writing and reading stories have always been a lot of fun to me. I especially love descriptive poetic works,
 which can take you to places that you could never be otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="comp">Computer Science</h2>

<div class="comp-sci"><p>At first, I didn't think much of computer science.
It never crossed my mind that I might get the oppurtunity to 
partake in a class like this.<br> I have come to endlessly enjoy computer science
and everything it offers, especially with computers being so prevalent nowadays.</p></div>

<h2 id="karuta">Karuta</h2>

<p class="karuta-para">Karuta is a japanese card game that was first introduced to me 
through an anime called <strong>"Chihayafuru".</strong><br> It's something that really 
caught my attention and still does to this day.<br> Although I don't 
play myself, I do find it fun to memorize all of the poems involoved
with the game.</p>
