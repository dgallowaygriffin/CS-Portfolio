<p class="p-1">Here you will learn about me,<strong> Divyne</strong>, the author of this webpage.
I will go in depth about my passions and interests, one of which is computer science. This page is 
just the beginning of the great things to come from my webpage, so I hope you decide to stick around.

 <h2>Literature</h2>
 <p class="p-2">Surprisingly enough, an interest of mine is a school subject, which is literature.
 Writing and reading stories have always been a lot of fun to me. I especially love descriptive poetic works,
 which can take you to places that you could never be otherwise.</p>
